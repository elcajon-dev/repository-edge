# Home Assistant Add-on: NextDNS Router

[![Release][release-shield]][release] ![Project Stage][project-stage-shield] ![Project Maintenance][maintenance-shield]

This add-on sets up NextDNS router CLI for your local network.

## About

NextDNS CLI is a DNS53 to DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) proxy with advanced capabilities
to get the most out of the NextDNS service. Although the most advanced features
will only work with NextDNS, this program can work as a client for any DoH
provider or a mix of NextDNS + another DNS (split horizon).
